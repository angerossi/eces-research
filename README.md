# eces-research
Portfolio repository for electrochemical energy storage research conducted at the University of Pretoria for carbon based electochemical capacitors.

Sample code for the analyses the cyclic voltammograms conducted for carbon based electrochemical capacitor electrodes is included in the CV folder. The results shown are randomised to protect the intellectual property of the study (ie, no actual results are shown). 

Various plots are shown included a matrix of all the CV curves, violin plots, scatter plots and cloud plots. A linear regression fitting (with binary interaction parameters) on the enclosed area of the curves has been shown and the feature importance has been plotted.
